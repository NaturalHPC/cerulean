Welcome to Cerulean's documentation!
==========================================================

Cerulean is a Python 3 library for connecting to HPC compute resources, such as
compute clusters and supercomputers. It lets you copy files between local and
SFTP filesystems using a ``pathlib``-like API, it lets you start processes
locally and remotely via SSH, and it lets you submit jobs to schedulers such as
Slurm and Torque/PBS.

Cerulean supports Python 3.4 and later.
