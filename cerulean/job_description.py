class JobDescription:
    """Describes a job to submit to a scheduler.

    Attributes:
        name (str): The name of the job, with which it will show up in the scheduler's
                queue. Cerulean does not use the name, but it may be useful if you
                manually check the queue.

        working_directory (str): The working directory to execute in.

        environment (Dict[str, str]): A dictionary of environment variables to define,
                and their values.

        command (str): The command to execute.

        arguments (list of str): A list of arguments to pass. If needed, you need to
                add quotes yourself, the arguments will not be escaped by cerulean.

        stdout_file (str): File to direct standard output to.

        stderr_file (str): File to direct standard error to.

        queue_name (str): Name of the queue to submit to.

        time_reserved (int): Time to reserve, in seconds.

        num_nodes (int): The number of nodes to reserve.

        mpi_processes_per_node (int): Number of MPI processes to start per node.

        system_out_file (str): File to direct the standard output of the scheduler to.

        system_err_file (str): File to direct the standard error of the scheduler to.

        extra_scheduler_options (str): Additional options to add to the scheduler
                command line on job submission. Note that these are scheduler-specific!

        Note that stdout_file and stderr_file will receive the output of the process
        you are starting, while system_out_file and system_err_file will receive
        messages from the scheduler (e.g. that the job ran out of its time limit and
        was killed). If stdout_file and/or stderr_file are not specified but
        system_out_file and/or system_err_file are, then the command output/error will
        end up in the system output/error file together with the scheduler output.
